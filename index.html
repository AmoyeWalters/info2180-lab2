            <h2> My Journey as an upcoming Software Engineer</h2>

            <p>During high school, I developed a deep love for science subjects. They revealed the
               intricate details of both simple and complex phenomena that occur in everyday life, and I was always
               excited to learn something new with each lesson. I also enjoyed technical subjects such as Information Technology, 
               Mechanical Engineering, and Electrical Engineering, finding them both challenging and fun. Despite my enthusiasm for
               these subjects, I was unsure about my future career path. In Grade 11, I considered becoming a pharmacist, inspired
               by my passion for science. However, when I applied for a pharmacy program, my application was denied. </p>

            <p>Feeling uncertain, I decided to apply for a degree in Software Engineering, a field I knew little about at the time.
                 This decision was influenced by a friend's recommendation, who also applied. Initially, I reached a near breaking point, 
                 fearing that my future prospects were dwindling. However, after overcoming a state of denial, I began to see this new direction
                  as a blessing in disguise. I hoped that this unexpected path would ignite my interest and lead me to a fulfilling career.</p>

            <p>During my time at university, I have learned an incredible amount, especially considering that Software Engineering was a completely
               new field for me. There were certainly rough times, but I am grateful for the decision to venture into this area despite having little 
               to no prior knowledge. This journey has been challenging yet rewarding, and it has sparked a genuine interest and passion for the field.

               Throughout my studies, I am hoping to work on various projects that will significantly enhance my understanding and skills. From 
               developing small applications to collaborating on larger, more complex systems, I look forward to each experience contributing to my
               growth as a software engineer. These projects will not only improve my technical abilities but also teach me the importance of teamwork,
               problem-solving, and continuous learning.</p>
            <p>As I approach the completion of my program, I am hopeful that the skills and knowledge I have gained will equip me to perform to the best
               of my abilities. I aim to serve my future employers and colleagues with dedication and competence, contributing meaningfully to any team I join.
               I am excited about the future and look forward to the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead in my software engineering career.</p>
